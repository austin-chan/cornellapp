Cornellapp is entirely written in Javascript (Node), allowing logic to be shared when executing code in the frontend and backend. Using the same language in the frontend and backend cuts down development time, obviates possible confusion between multiple languages, and most importantly allows client-side rendering to be run in the server-side environment, making the application a single isomorphic entity. The isomorphic structure enables the application to deliver pre-rendered pages that only need to be initialized in the client-side instead of delivering empty pages that need to be completely built client-side. This prevents the modern phenomenon known as
